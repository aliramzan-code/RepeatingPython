#Variables :
    #variables are containers that store data values.
    #For Example X = "Python"
    #in python you have to assign value to variable at first
    #In python you do't need to define the type of variable
x = 4
print(x)
    #and at the same time you can change the type of variable by just changing the value
x = "Python"
print(x)
    #You can specifiy the data type using casting 
x = str(4)
x = int(4)
x = str(4)
x = float(4)

    #Casting is a process of covernting data type to another data type 
    #if you want to know the type of variable you can use type() method
y = "Hi"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
    #the output will : <class 'float'>
    #<class 'str'>
    #Strings are sequnce of characters it cantains numbers,letters , symbols and even speces
    #
