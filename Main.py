#Variables :
    #variables are containers that store data values.
    #For Example X = "Python"
    #in python you have to assign value to variable at first
    #In python you do't need to define the type of variable
x = 4
print(x)
    #and at the same time you can change the type of variable by just changing the value
x = "Python"
print(x)
    #You can specifiy the data type using casting 
x = str(4)
x = int(4)
x = str(4)
x = float(4)

    #Casting is a process of covernting data type to another data type 
    #if you want to know the type of variable you can use type() method
y = "Hi"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
    #the output will : <class 'float'>
    #<class 'str'>
    #Strings are sequnce of characters it cantains numbers,letters , symbols and even speces
    #Everything in single and double quoutes or String in python 
    #Python is case-sensitve langauge 
    #for example 
a = 3
A = "Python"
    #these are two different variables

    #There are some Python rules for decarling Variables 
    # Rules
    # 1.  A variable must start with a letter or underscore character.
    # 2.  A variable cannot start with number .
    # 3.  A varibale name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores(A-Z,0-9,_)
    # 4.  A varibale name is case-sensitive(age, Age , AGE are three different names)
    # 5.  A variable name cannot be any of Python-Keyword
